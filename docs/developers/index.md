# Developers ||10

Welcome! Here you can train yourself to be a holochain developer.

On the left, you have a list of exercises, ordered from easier to harder. 
Start with the [setup](/developers/requirements/setup) and the [anatomy](/developers/requirements/anatomy) lesson to get ready. 
Then start your [first exercise](/developers/basic/entries).

Good luck!
