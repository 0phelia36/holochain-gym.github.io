# Exercises for Developers ||10

Welcome! Here you can train yourself to be a holochain developer.

To start, clone the exercises repository: https://github.com/holochain-gym/developer-exercises.

You can access the exercises with the menu at the left. Every exercise will have a short explanation video, some documentation or sample code and instructions

To finish an exercise, you must replace all `unimplemented` functions with working implementations, and **make all the tests pass**. 

It's better to be following the exercises from start to end, since earlier concepts are needed to understand the following ones.

Good luck!
