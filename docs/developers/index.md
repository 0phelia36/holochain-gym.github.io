# Developers ||10

Welcome! Here you can train yourself to be a holochain developer.

On the left, you have a list of exercises, ordered from easier to harder. Start with the [setup](/developers/requirements/setup) to get ready, and then [get started with first exercise](/developers/beginner/elements).

Good luck!
