From experience, we know that one of the major blockers while learning holochain is rust. This is one of the reasons that the gym exists, to have nice interactive exercises without needing to do any coding at all.

Learning rust is outside the scope of the gym by itself. However, here you can find a fabulous list of resources to start learning rust specifically targeted at holochain beginners:
