# Requirements >> Setup ||10

If you haven't, install `nix-shell` following the instructions of the holochain [getting started guide](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/). Note that to complete the exercises you only need `nix-shell` installed, since they will already contain the necessary files to get you set up with holochain RSM itself.

To setup the code exercises that follow along the sections of this page, clone the [developer-exercises repository](https://github.com/holochain-gym/developer-exercises).

You can access the exercises with the menu at the left. Every exercise will have some kind of interactive playground, some documentation or sample code and instructions.

To finish an exercise, you must replace all `unimplemented` functions with working implementations, and **make all the tests pass**. 

```js script
import '@rocket/launch/inline-notification/inline-notification.js';
```

It's better to be following the exercises from start to end, since earlier concepts are needed to understand the following ones.

If you get stuck with some exercise, the developer-exercises has a [solution branch](https://github.com/holochain-gym/developer-exercises/tree/solution) that you can look at for complete working solutions. Try not to use this too much though!
