# Requirements >> Setup ||10

To start, clone the [developer-exercises repository](https://github.com/holochain-gym/developer-exercises).

You can access the exercises with the menu at the left. Every exercise will have a short explanation video, some documentation or sample code and instructions

To finish an exercise, you must replace all `unimplemented` functions with working implementations, and **make all the tests pass**. 

```js script
import '@rocket/launch/inline-notification/inline-notification.js';
```
<inline-notification type="warning" title="Order of exercises">

It's better to be following the exercises from start to end, since earlier concepts are needed to understand the following ones.

<inline-notification type="tip" title="Solutions">

If you get stuck with some exercise, the developer-exercises has a [solution branch](https://github.com/holochain-gym/developer-exercises/tree/solution) that you can look at for complete working solutions. Try not to use this too much though!
